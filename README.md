<h1>Carmen Finder</h1>
<h2>Where ... In the world is ______________ ? </h2>
<p>Carmen is a Spotlike search UI modal. When carmen is invoked, a familiar global search modal appears in the middle of the screen. Triggering another one replaces the previous carmen modal so they don't stack up. Tab out (any onblur method will work) to remove it.</p>
